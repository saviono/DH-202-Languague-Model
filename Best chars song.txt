let's do it all for my baby
don't you give me your love baby
and step down, they don't see my ones ain't no problems!
no problems
when's daddy ever gonna change
you know i don't
cause you're a little rubber later on this special love last forever
nobody know how to run things
livin' in the streets, so many chances
searching for you
you turn a corner in the night
i know, i know that we'll be singin'

i love rock n' roll
so come and make a night you won't see me blush, but i can make this my last chance
we're gonna die young
we're gonna love her as she looking good to celebrate
holiday ooohooohooohooo
well, it reminded me of the game, they run through the days and nights we don't really care about us

mmm babe
i can't stay
don't have to try
lay down tonight, girl
and i'ma make it right

baby, if you've got to boogie
on the disc
thelonius, my description
and if it feels good
i feel it coming together
we will stand on the wall on the ding-a-ling
won't you call my name
come on y'all come with fries
love it when i see the way i treat her like a man

she waan a man weh mek she fly like kites never get away, get away from me
i'm giving you, giving you ever seen the moon disappear
you're still a part of your crowd?
i never had that feeling
streetlights
no tomorrow
and ooooohhhh, they call their own
they watchin' us while we dancing in the middle of the night and i got it goin' on with the radio
and sing with that hip still real mother for my chance
don't stop now
you can't out run the race is not, for the sunday shoes
please, baby, please don't play yourself
move on back two squares
send an instant
i knew the plan
and it didn't stop
they just sayin' if you got it move it boy
yeah
