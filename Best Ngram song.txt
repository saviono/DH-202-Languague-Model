paint the sky
dream on, dream on 
tryin' to say... 

life will never die 
hollerin' for mercy 
say you'll never shine if you want to know this, check it out my cypher keeps moving 
just say no 
i wonder if i could never lose, what you like 
she's got electric boots, a mohair suit 
knock three times on the front seat of my car 
i can make me feel good 
sha, sha-ba-dah, sha-ba-dah, feel good 
showin' much flex when it's you run 
no regrets, just love the way you do 
ooh, ooh, the joy 
you got a drinkin' problem 
yeah, boo, i dun told you to know the game 
imagination 
you are 

it's just another day, another breath 
she paid it no more of that ring, get rid of those two polar opposite spectrums instead of kisses, we get it, skrrt 
i'm down to the, move to the front 
hair weave off your neck ties to purple labels 
upgrade you, i promise i'll be crazy 
well, they sweatin' when they move their lips 
drench yourself in jesus' hands. 
grandma's hands played a lot more love make you put yours, and i am finished with you 
but what about us? 
we turn this room says not hardly 
odd-ly enough, i guess i was rolling one up in my zone 

no no oh no, babe 
i ain't nobody's fool, bump you like 
baby 
if or if we fall 
i keep in contact with certain exes 
do you remember, when i pick you up i got one like me 
i got to do this no beer 
hes always around like 4l-dub, i'm calling mo' niggas 
this mirror's telling no lie 
real hasta la nube 
pa pa l'americano 

i'll be movin' 
it's time to say 
i can't stop the war, now 
i'm living in san antone and santa fe 
or are we waiting on? 
i asked her why we're who we are, we are diamonds taking shape 
shape it up cause girl, i gotta be fresh as hell 
chains of love and i ride his dick through his mane 
- the words of scarface, again
